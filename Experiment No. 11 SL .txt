Use the NESSUS to scan the network for vulnerabilities
    
   
Nessus is one of the most popular and capable vulnerability scanners, particularly for UNIX systems. It was initially free and open source, but they closed the source code in 2005 and removed the free "Registered Feed" version in 2008. It now costs $1,200 per year, which still beats many of its competitors. A free "Home Feed" is also available, though it is limited and only licensed for home network use. Nessus is constantly updated with more than 46,000 plug-ins. Key features include remote and local (authenticated) security checks, client/server architecture with a web-based interface, and an embedded scripting language for writing your own plug-ins or understanding the existing ones.
